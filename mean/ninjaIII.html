        <h1>Ninja Class III</h1>
        <p>Part I: Recreate the base Ninja class from scratch using ES6 classes. Your Ninja needs the following attributes:</p>
        <p>- Name, Health, Speed, Strength</p>
        <p>Speed and strength should be 3 by default. Health should be 100 by default.</p>

        <p>The Ninja class should have the following methods:</p>
        <p>1. sayName() - This should log that Ninja's name to the console.</p>
        <p>2. showStats() - This should show the Ninja's Strength and Speed, as well as their health.</p>
        <p>3. drinkSake() - This should add +10 Health to the Ninja</p>

        <p>Part II - Sensei Class</p>
        <p>Extend the Ninja class and create the Sensei class. A Sensei should have 200 Health, 10 speed, and 10 strength by default. In addition, a Sensei should have a new attribute called wisdom, and the default should be 10. Finally, add the speakWisdom() method. speakWisdom() should call the drinkSake() method from the Ninja class, before console.logging a wise message.</p>
